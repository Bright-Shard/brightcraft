I learned Java by making cheats for Minecraft. Genius.

This mod runs on [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net), and requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).

# Use
***NOTICE***: BrightCraft was just made for fun on singleplayer worlds or servers that support cheating. BrightCraft
was *not* made for use on public servers (e.g. Hypixel) and will *certainly* get you banned (BrightCraft doesn't have
many anticheat bypasses). Please don't ruin other peoples' fun with these cheats.

Obviously, if you do get banned by using these cheats, I'm not responsible. I'm actively telling you to *not* use them
on public servers. If you disregard that and get banned, **it's your fault, not mine**.

## Cheats
- NoClip (Only works on singleplayer)
- Fly
- Jetpack
- NoFallDamage
- FastBreak
- FullBright
- XRay (Currently incompatible with shader mods, like Iris or Optifine/Optifabric)
- Speed

## Other Features
- Configurable XRay blocks
- GUI to customize/toggle cheats (Open from in-game settings or by pressing RSHIFT)
- Keybinds to toggle cheats (Change from the in-game controls settings)
- When cheats are toggled, BrightCraft notifies you in-chat (Of course, only you can see that chat)
- Whenever you join a world/server, BrightCraft tells you what cheats are currently enabled in-chat
